# app-store-connect-mcp

MCP server for App Store Connect — 21 tools covering apps, TestFlight, customer reviews, sales/finance reports, and team users via the [App Store Connect API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi).

## Setup

Set three env vars in your MCP host config:

- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID` — 10-character Key ID (e.g. `ABC1234567`)
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID` — Team Issuer ID (UUID)
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` — absolute path to your downloaded `.p8` file (or paste PEM into `APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY`)

Generate a key at [appstoreconnect.apple.com → Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api). Save the `.p8` (only downloadable once).

## Tools

### Apps
- `list_apps` — List apps (filter by bundleId/name)
- `get_app` — App details by ID
- `list_app_store_versions` — Releases for an app
- `get_app_infos` — Age rating and store-state info

### TestFlight
- `list_builds` — Recent builds, newest first
- `get_build` — Single build details
- `list_beta_groups` — Internal & external beta groups
- `list_beta_testers` — Testers, filter by app/group/email
- `invite_beta_tester` — Add a new tester (optionally to groups/builds)
- `delete_beta_tester` — Remove tester from team
- `add_testers_to_beta_group` — Bulk add to a group
- `remove_testers_from_beta_group` — Bulk remove from a group
- `submit_build_for_beta_review` — Send build for beta review

### Customer Reviews
- `list_customer_reviews` — Reviews for an app, filter by rating/territory
- `get_customer_review` — Single review with developer response
- `respond_to_review` — Post or update reply

### Sales & Finance
- `download_sales_report` — Daily/weekly/monthly/yearly units & sales TSV
- `download_finance_report` — Region-scoped finance/proceeds TSV

### Team Users
- `list_users` — Team users
- `list_user_invitations` — Pending invitations
- `invite_user` — Invite new team member with roles

## Common workflows

**Triage low-rated reviews**
1. `list_customer_reviews` with `rating: 1` (sorted `-createdDate` by default)
2. For each, `get_customer_review` to see if there's already a response
3. `respond_to_review` to reply

**Promote a build to external testers**
1. `list_builds` with `appId` to find the build (look for `processingState: VALID`)
2. `submit_build_for_beta_review` with that build's ID
3. After Apple approval, `add_testers_to_beta_group` for the external group

**Onboard a new beta tester**
1. `list_beta_groups` with `appId` to find the right group
2. `invite_beta_tester` with `email`, optional name, and `betaGroupIds`

**Daily sales pull**
- `download_sales_report` with your `vendorNumber` (from App Store Connect → Payments and Financial Reports), `reportDate: YYYY-MM-DD`, default `frequency: DAILY`
- Reports are typically available ~24h after the close of the date

## Notes

- App Store Connect uses JSON:API: filters are `filter[name]=value`, sorts use `-` prefix for descending.
- All write operations (invites, deletions, review responses, beta review submission) require an API key with sufficient role (App Manager or Admin for most TestFlight/team work).
- Sales reports come back as gzipped TSVs and are auto-parsed into row objects. The tool truncates after `limit` rows (default 500) but reports the total row count.
- Expect a real `.p8` file path (or PEM string). The MCP signs short-lived (20-minute) ES256 JWTs locally — your private key never leaves the machine.
